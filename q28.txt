I’m a huge foodie. My friends and I love trying new restaurants in town as soon as they open, the more unusual the better! I love discovering new foods and cuisines, and it’s also a great activity to share with friends. I try to go out with the same group at least once a week and it’s a fun way to make sure we keep in touch and share experiences even when we’re busy with other things. We even took a trip to New York City and spent each day in a different neighbourhood, buying something to share from a few restaurants.
One of my big interests has always been soccer. I played throughout school, and in college when I studied abroad in Spain, my passion for the sport was reawakened because of how enthusiastic the people around me were. I still follow European teams and I play with a local rec team. I even help arrange the schedule for the whole league including times and locations. Last year, I coached my daughter’s soccer team for the first time. They’re only four, but getting to pass on something I love is so rewarding and there’s a lot of satisfaction in figuring out the best way to teach each of the kids a new skill
During my spare time, I enjoy running. In the week I like to stay local but during the weekend I usually complete a more scenic and challenging route. I sometimes run with the local running club, it’s a great way to socialise and to stay motivated by encouraging each other. In a couple of months, I have planned to take part in the Manchester Half Marathon and raise money for a local charity.
Thanks for asking! I love playing the piano. I am actually in a classical music band called the “Classicools” and we perform all around town at various venues. We meet up and practice every Saturday at my house. But I also spend a lot of time after work practicing songs or writing new music if I am bored.
