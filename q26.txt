In my most recent performance review in April, my direct supervisor described me as someone who takes initiative and doesn’t shy away from hard problems. My role involves a lot of on-site implementations, and when things go wrong, it’s usually up to me to fix it. Rather than punting the problem back to the team, I always try to do what I can first. I know she appreciates that about me.
One thing I’ve noticed is that I’m always the one people turn to for recommendations on how to handle a new event or program, the latest fundraiser that I just told you about would be one. I have a lot of institutional knowledge, which helps, but I think the reason people come to me is because I work through what a new program might look like very methodically. If you were to ask my colleagues, I’m confident they’d describe me as logical, organized, and meticulous.”
I don’t want to speak for anyone else, but I’m pretty confident my colleagues would describe me as thoughtful, I’m the one in the office who remembers everyone’s birthdays, and hard-working, since I can always be relied on to get a big project over the finish line. My boss in particular would say I’m very knowledgeable about audience development, it’s why I kept taking on more and more responsibilities in that domain.”
My past co-workers would say that I am very cheery and optimistic. I would think they would say this because I’ve demonstrated how I see setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. There is always a creative solution to a problem, no matter what it is, and I genuinely love searching for it and working with a team to find it. One instance that comes to mind was when previous co-workers from my last job were upset and worried about budget cuts to our IT department. I brainstormed a few clever ways to maintain some of our resources on a tiny budget. They ended up being implemented, and everyone was delighted with the result.
