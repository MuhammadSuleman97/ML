“I enjoy having my hands in a lot of different projects, so I like working with managers who allow their employees to experiment, be independent, and work cross-functionally with other teams. At the same time, I really welcome it when a boss provides me with support, guidance, and coaching. No one can do anything alone, and I believe when managers and employees collaborate together and learn from one another everyone comes out on top.”
“The bosses I’ve worked best with in the past have set clear, concise, and realistic goals and expectations. I’m highly motivated by deadlines and being a part of not just my team’s success but the whole companies, so working with someone who takes both of these things seriously and ties them back to everything they do allows me to perform at my best.
I only hope to continue to grow and improve as a leader, so I’d really appreciate a boss who’s willing to put themselves in my shoes and mentor me as I lead my team. I wouldn’t need them to be on call all the time, but just having that sounding board every once in a while, to bounce ideas off of and practice giving feedback with would be incredibly helpful. My last boss did a really good job of this, and as a result of their tutelage I was able to train and propel the success of my three direct reports.”
Since I am new to the field, I like to be managed actively. That means having a daily contact with my superior. I am sure I will have many questions, and it will take me some time to learn the job. That’s why it is important to have a leader, someone who can guide me in the right direction. What’s more, it is important for me to have someone I can call or write to at any time, when I feel like I need help, or might misunderstand something. That’s the type of management I am looking for, and hopefully I can find it in your place.
