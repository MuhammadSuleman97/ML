I was let go through something that was entirely my fault. I loved my work and the company. My supervisor and I used to exchange ideas openly, which of course is healthy for any workplace. Yet one day she and I were discussing one particular idea and the conversation got so passionate that it appeared to her that I was resisting her authority, which of course was not my intention. Since then, I have made sure that I keep my tone down when discussing ideas so that my objectives are not misinterpreted.
After working for XYZ Inc. for four years, there were some changes made to the amount of client calls we were expected to process per hour. I used the techniques we were taught after the change took effect but didn’t want our customer service to slip. Unfortunately, I wasn’t consistently completing the required number of calls, and, as a result, I was let go. I felt really bad about this and in retrospect I could have done better sticking to the process that would have let me meet the per hour quota. But you’ve told me about the customer service standards and the volume expectations here, and I believe it won’t be a problem.
I broke a policy related to use of my company credit card. Everything got sorted out, but unfortunately my manager didn't have any option left other than letting me go. I wasn't as careful as I needed to be and that is never going to happen again.
I was dealing with a serious health issue and unfortunately it impacted my work at the company I was working at. I wish they would have been able to offer me more support, but I understand that they needed to have a job done and I wasn't in a position to be able to do it at that time. The best thing for everyone involved was for me to focus on my health, so that's what I did. I have my health issue under control and don’t expect disruptions to my work going forward.
