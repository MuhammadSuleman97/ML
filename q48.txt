I do love living in Raleigh and would prefer to stay here. However, for the right opportunity I’d be willing to consider relocating if necessary.
I’m really excited about this opportunity and feel I could provide great value in this role. I would definitely be open to relocation and look forward to learning more details around this.
I actually have been looking to relocate to [location]/have family in [location]/am looking for a change of scenery, so this job would be the perfect opportunity to make a change and also do work I’m excited about.
I’m really passionate about this role but am pretty content where I live now and can’t commit to relocating at this time. However, I’d be more than willing to make it work remotely/work out of [location] office if you see that as a possibility.
