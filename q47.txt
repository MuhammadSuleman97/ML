I am excited for the opportunity to join your team. I have several projects to wrap up in my current role at my current company. I plan to give them two weeks’ notice to make a smooth transition for my co-workers and will be happy to come onboard with the team here after that time.
I’m really looking forward to being part of the team. However, I do have some previously scheduled commitments to attend to after giving notice at my current job. My ideal start date would be [number of weeks] from a potential offer.
I could possibly start tomorrow, but it won’t be responsible from my side. Look, I need to train my successor, and help them to takeover my existing projects. I had a good relationship with my present employer, I learned a lot in the company, and simply do not want to leave just like that. Considering this, I may need two or three weeks to help them with the transition, and then I will be ready to start the job with you.
