Ever since my brother was diagnosed with a heart condition, I’ve been training and running with him in your annual Heart Run to raise money for your organization and help support patients with expenses not covered by insurance. Each time, I’ve been struck by how truly dedicated and happy to be there your employees have been. So when I saw this posting for a fundraising role, it felt like it was meant to be. For the last 10 years of my career, I’ve been an account executive for various SaaS companies, and I’ve really honed my skills when it comes to convincing organizations to make regular payments for something over the long-term. But I’ve been looking for a position in fundraising where I can use these skills to really help people and I’m highly motivated to do that with your organization.
I changed career paths because I wanted to do something more challenging. I didn´t want to wake up every day and feel like I was doing the same thing repeatedly. After researching different career, I found one that would allow me to use my skills and talents in a way that would challenge me.
Although working in corporate finance was a financially rewarding career, it was not one that I was passionate about. As a lifelong foodie, the opportunity to move into the culinary field has always appealed to me, and the money I saved in my previous job gives me the luxury of moving into a new field at a lower level. The opportunity to work in a restaurant in a management position allows me to use my considerable business skills in an industry that I am passionate about.
I love being a Project Manager and I've really honed my skills working at a fast-paced Fintech company, however, during Covid I became really passionate about healthcare. I'm looking to transfer my project management skills to a healthcare company that's using technology to make it more accessible for people.
