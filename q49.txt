Being a target-oriented, committed, and devoted individual, I would love to transform myself into the bald eagle. These eagles have the ability to be vigilant and attentive almost all the time with a sharp eye focusing only and only on the target or goal to be achieved. One can adopt so many things from this lovely creature, along with being fearless, tenacious, and quality to create high visions.
If I ever get a chance, I would love to be a lion, the king of the jungle. If you have ever observed, a lion can do almost anything to pursue its prey. Its dedication and perseverance are commendable. If we deploy the same level of sincerity, focus, and concentration in our work, I feel, we too can achieve great heights and one day might become a senior manager or maybe the CEO of the company.
If I ever get a chance, I will be a dolphin. Because dolphins are chatty animals besides being intelligent and skillful. They always possess a charming attitude with friendly nature and the ability to move or go on with a team. In addition to this, they are quick learners and can perform daunting tasks if trained well. I believe, dolphins are the animals close to my heart and I wish, I become one.
As busy as a honeybee. The best thing about honeybees is the level of dedication, perseverance, and ability to stay focused and committed to the repetitive work almost 24 hours and 365 days of the year. If humans, ever adopt the qualities of a honeybee, there is nothing that humans canâ€™t achieve in his or her life. There is everything for a hard-working person in this world, and arguably, honeybees are the most hard-working creature to have ever lived in my knowledge. So, being a career-oriented person, I want to be a honeybee.
