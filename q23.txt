I really like the environment in my current position. My manager is a great resource and always willing to help when I run into an issue, but they trust me to get my work done so I have a lot of freedom in how I schedule and prioritize, which is very important to me. Everyone has their own cubicle, so it’s often pretty quiet to get our work done, but we all get lunch together and our team has a lot of check-in meetings and communicates frequently via Slack so we still get a lot of opportunities to bounce ideas off each other. So, I like both individual and more collaborative work. How would you describe the mix here?
I can be flexible when it comes to my work environment. From your website, it looks like the environment in the engineering department here at RRS is fast-paced and structured to expand production. I enjoy working in an area experiencing rapid growth, and I think this kind of environment is conducive to new ideas and applications.
I’ve really thrived in more collaborative environments. I prefer a setting where everyone’s input is taken into consideration because I believe approaching any project with a range of perspectives is better in the long run. For that reason, I also prefer an open office like you have here so that it’s easy to check in with other team members, my managers, and even people on other teams who might bring fresh ideas to a problem or have other areas of expertise. That being said, I really like the privacy rooms you pointed out because in some situations I do work better when I can step away and really focus to get things done after I’ve gotten the input I need.
I enjoy working in an environment where the members of the team have a strong sense of camaraderie and a good work ethic. I like working with competent, kind, funny people who like to get things done. It’s important to me to feel that I can trust my team members to always do their best because I do.
