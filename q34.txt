It bothers me when an office’s schedule is really disorganized, because in my experience, disorganization can cause confusion, which can hurt the motivation of the team. As a person who likes things to be orderly, I try to help keep my team on task while also allowing for flexibility.
In the past, I didn’t like when my supervisor seemed to always be checking in on my work. So, I’ve learned to work on creating clear expectations about when and how to update my managers about my progress, like setting a weekly calendar reminder to meet briefly with them.
I’ve worked in places where some people leading meetings didn’t seem to use the time as efficiently as they could have, which made me feel like I wasn’t being productive either. I’ve tried to work on this issue by providing a model for how things could be different: by running my own meetings in a streamlined way and passing out agendas beforehand.
I noticed that one of my co-workers always seemed to interrupt me when I was in the middle of making a point. For a few weeks, I was frustrated. But then I spoke to him one on one about what was going on, and the interruptions stopped, he hadn’t realized how his behavior was affecting me.
