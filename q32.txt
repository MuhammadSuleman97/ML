One of my favourite pastimes is knitting, I love being able to create something beautiful from nothing. Of course, knitting also requires a keen attention to detail and a lot of patience. Luckily, as an accountant I have cultivated both of those qualities!”
This probably isn't surprising coming from an engineer, but I love experimenting with code. For example, when I started playing World of Warcraft, I really hated the interface, so I wanted to try to write my own. I had to teach myself a new coding language, Lua, and seek out communities that supported that language, and communities of other people who were mudding the same game. I really enjoyed the process of discovery and getting feedback from the community. It's exactly why I enjoy what I do all day as an engineer.
I’ve gotten really interested in personal finance lately, so I started a blog and I’ve been creating weekly posts for it. It’s been fun to use my content and marketing skills on a type of content that’s really different from my day job, and I’ve had a chance to learn a lot more about SEO, too.
I’m actually a semi-pro tennis player and spend most of my spare time training. In fact, all of my vacation time in the past few years has been used to travel around the country to compete. Playing this sport has given me drive and focus and makes me even more productive at work so I can complete my tasks efficiently and still have time for training.
