I took a six-month sabbatical to immerse myself in a different culture, and as a result, I’ve gained a new perspective and learned some valuable life lessons. I feel much more ready to dive back into my career.
I spent several years working at a company in a very demanding job, in which, as you’ll see from my references, I was very successful. But I’d reached a stage in my career where I wanted to focus on my personal growth. The time I spent traveling taught me a lot about how to get along with people of all ages and cultures. Now I feel more than ready to jump back into my career with renewed energy and focus and I feel this role is the ideal way to do that.
The last company I worked for needed to make significant cuts in 2014 due to substantial losses in revenue. Unfortunately- my position was on the chopping block- and I ended up being laid off. It was honestly the first time something like that had happened to me- and took a while for me to adjust. I began immediately applying to all jobs I was qualified for, but nothing really stuck. My spouse makes a good enough income to support both of us, so I decided that time was as good as any to pursue a passion of mine: helping animals. I started volunteering at a local shelter four days a week doing whatever I could to ensure dogs and cats found their forever homes. I feel like that experience has allowed me to develop key skills that would be useful in this position.
As much as I appreciate all the opportunities my last boss gave me- it became abundantly clear after working there for two years that there was no more room for advancement. We parted ways amicably, and I focused on the most important thing in my life: my children. For the last year I have been a stay-at-home mom- and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience to see my kids grow up. I am ready to get back into the workforce with some new skills- including how to carry a baby while vacuuming!
