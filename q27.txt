Pressure is very important to me. Good pressure, such as having many assignments or an upcoming deadline—helps me to stay motivated and productive. Of course, there are times when too much pressure can lead to stress. However, I'm very skilled at balancing multiple projects and meeting deadlines; this ability prevents me from feeling overly stressed. For example, I once had three large projects due in the same week, and that was a lot of pressure. However, because I created a schedule that detailed how I would break down each project into small assignments, I managed to complete all three projects ahead of time and avoided unnecessary stress.
I actually work better under pressure, and I've found that I enjoy working in a challenging environment. As a writer and editor, I thrive under tight deadlines and multiple projects. I find that when I have to work to a deadline, I can produce some of my most creative work. For example, my latest article, for which I won a regional writing award, was assigned to me only days before the due date. I used the pressure of that deadline to harness my creativity and focus.
I stay motivated by thinking about the end result. I’ve found that even in the midst of a challenging situation, reminding myself of my goals helps me take a step back and stay positive.
I realize that, as a manager, my response to stress will affect my whole team. My goal would be to model what I’d want my team to do, so I’d openly communicate that there was a high-stress situation and ask if anyone had the time to pitch in and help troubleshooting
