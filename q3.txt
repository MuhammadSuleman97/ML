I actively job searching right now and found your job posting on LinkedIn while searching for Senior Engineer positions. I reviewed the job description on LinkedIn before applying, and it seemed like a great potential fit, so I wanted to apply and learn more about the opportunity to see if it’s a good match.
I heard about this position from one of your current employees, June Baker. She was my coworker when I worked for Company-, where I served as a sales representative for five years. She recently notified me that your company might have a few positions opening up-, so I did a little research to see what might be available. This position really stood out to me as somewhere where I can use my talents and my skills to the best of my ability and learn a lot more about the industry as my career grows and develops.
