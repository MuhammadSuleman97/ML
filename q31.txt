I’d be lost without my daily to-do list! At the beginning of each workday, I write out tasks to complete, and list them from highest to lowest priority to help keep me on track. But I also realize priorities change unexpectedly.
The first thing I do is to look at the complete picture and then consider a given task in context. I apply an Eisenhower matrix and use it to consider the importance and value of each task. I work hard to eliminate as many tasks as possible, which reduces the amount of time wasted overall. I then try to delegate as many remaining tasks as I can. Of what is left, I determine what absolutely must be done today and their order of urgency. I complete as many of the remaining tasks as possible on the same day and defer any incomplete ones to another day. 
I start task planning by recognizing that I only have limited time each day and that there are always enough tasks to fill a day. I look at my tasks and determine the most important. I then estimate the time required to complete each task properly. I can then prioritize the most important tasks that I have time to complete and assess which tasks fit into the time available. By doing this, I can communicate with my manager ahead of time and set realistic expectations for each day and week.
“I make it a point to keep lines of communication open with my manager and co-workers. If I’m working on a task that will take a while to complete, I try to give a heads-up to my team as soon as possible. If my workload gets to be unmanageable, I check in with my boss about which items can drop to the bottom of the priority list, and then I try to reset expectations about different deadlines.”
